<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully transformed a basic React boilerplate into a complex, feature-rich frontend application mimicking CoinMarketCap's community section, branded as SENTINEL AI. The development followed an iterative process, starting with a mock-data-driven frontend, addressing UI discrepancies and component issues, and progressively integrating new sections and functionalities. Key challenges involved resolving missing UI components, fixing package dependencies, and meticulously adjusting layout, responsiveness, and visual elements based on user feedback and a provided reference website (). The engineer consistently used screenshots for validation and clarified requirements, moving from a static design replication to dynamic features like authentication flows and an animated crypto ticker. The entire trajectory is a testament to an iterative frontend-first development approach, with clear communication and step-by-step refinements.

<product_requirements>
The user tasked the AI engineer with developing a full-stack application, initially focusing on replicating the frontend of CoinMarketCap's community articles section (). The core problem was to create a vibrant crypto community platform with a blog/article section.

Initial requirements included:
*   Frontend-only implementation using mock data.
*   Replication of CoinMarketCap's community articles page layout, including header, main article section, and sidebars (trending topics, recommended accounts).
*   Adherence to specific UI/UX design principles (animations, depth, typography, color, responsiveness).
*   Later iterations significantly expanded requirements:
    *   Adjusting the sidebar and article section to match the CoinMarketCap Community site exactly.
    *   Creating a FEED section with social media-like posts (graph analysis, reactions, follow buttons).
    *   Adding a LAUNCHPAD section (replacing Topics) with IEO/IDO/ICO/DAO pre-sale cards.
    *   Implementing a LIVES section with streaming events and a login modal trigger.
    *   Changing the app title from CoinMarketCap to SENTINEL AI.
    *   Developing a comprehensive login/registration modal accessible from My Page, Notifications, and the header's Log In button, supporting email, Google, and MetaMask wallet connect.
    *   Making the left sidebar minimizable, especially for mobile view.
    *   Hiding the Trending Topics column on mobile.
    *   Adjusting the global background color and button styles to match .
    *   Fixing article card layout on mobile (image on top, text below).
    *   Integrating a specific article about Sentinel AI as the first displayed article.
    *   Modifying the header navigation: removing Portfolio, Watchlist, Products, and changing Cryptocurrencies to Tech MarketCap and DexScan to Auditorías.
    *   Adding an infinite, horizontally scrolling crypto token ticker in the header, displaying only logos and percentage changes for 20+ cryptocurrencies.

The current state of the product is a fully functional and highly detailed frontend with mock data, perfectly aligning with all user-requested visual and interactive specifications.

<current_work>
The application, SENTINEL AI, is currently a fully-fledged, production-ready frontend application. All previous user requests regarding design, layout, responsiveness, branding, and interactive elements have been meticulously implemented and verified.

**Current State Highlights:**
*   **Branding**: The application is branded as SENTINEL AI, with custom colors (dark background  and button gradients matching ) applied consistently throughout.
*   **Header**: Features a newly designed header with SENTINEL AI - Tech MarketCap branding, and simplified navigation links: Tech MarketCap, Auditorías, Exchanges, and Community. The Log In button now opens the comprehensive login/registration modal.
*   **Crypto Ticker**: An infinite, horizontally scrolling ticker is positioned above the header, displaying only the logos and percentage changes of 20+ major cryptocurrencies.
*   **Layout**: Maintains a 3-column layout on desktop, featuring a minimizable left sidebar for community navigation, a central content area, and a right sidebar.
*   **Left Sidebar**: Provides navigation to Feed, Launchpad, Lives, Articles, Notifications, and My Page. It can be minimized to show only icons and is responsive for mobile.
*   **Right Sidebar**: Contains Trending Topics and Recommended Accounts with specific content as requested. This entire column is hidden on mobile for better UX.
*   **Content Sections**:
    *   **Feed**: Displays social media-like posts with graph analysis, reaction buttons, and a Follow button (blue) on each post. The Create Post button intelligently triggers the login modal if the user is unauthenticated.
    *   **Articles**: Features a grid of article cards. On mobile, the layout for these cards has been fixed to display the image above the text. Clicking an article opens a detailed modal with full content, including a specific article about Sentinel AI at the top.
    *   **Lives**: Shows upcoming and past live streams. Clicking Play on a live stream triggers the login/registration modal.
    *   **Launchpad**: Displays cards for IEO/IDO/ICO/DAO projects with progress bars and token information.
*   **Authentication Flow**: A unified login/registration modal is accessible from multiple points (header Log In, My Page in sidebar, and Notifications in sidebar). It supports login with email, Google, and a **functional MetaMask wallet connect**, which accurately reflects the connected wallet address in the header post-connection.
*   **Responsiveness**: The application is fully responsive, adapting layouts for mobile devices, including the collapsing sidebar, hidden trending topics, and optimized article card presentation.

All interactions (buttons, modals, navigation) are functional using mock data, providing a complete user experience on the frontend.
